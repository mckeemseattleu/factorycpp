Advantages of the Factory Method
Below are the main advantages of factory method design pattern:

Separates creation logic from client code, improving flexibility.
New product types can be added easily.
Simplifies unit testing by allowing mock product creation.
Centralizes object creation logic across the application.
Hides specific product classes from clients, reducing dependency.
Disadvantages of the Factory Method
Below are the main advantages of factory method design pattern:

Adds more classes and interfaces, which can complicate maintenance.
Slight performance impacts due to polymorphism.
Concrete creators are linked to their products.
Clients need knowledge of specific subclasses.
May lead to unnecessary complexity if applied too broadly.
Factory logic can be harder to test.
